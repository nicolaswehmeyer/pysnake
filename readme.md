# PySnake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## How to Play

1. Run the `pysnake.py` file.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake:
   - Up arrow: Move the snake up
   - Down arrow: Move the snake down
   - Left arrow: Move the snake left
   - Right arrow: Move the snake right
3. Try to eat the food (red square) to make the snake grow.
4. Avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the game boundaries.
5. The game ends when the snake collides, and a Game Over screen appears.
6. Press 'Q' to quit the game or 'R' to retry.
